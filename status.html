           <span> Financial discrimination</span> is discrimination based on<br> economic factors. It is a tragedy that most of the<br> worldâ€™s wealth is owned by very few people. In fact,<br> global financial inequality is growing, <span> with half the<br> worldâ€™s wealth</span> now in the hands of <span> just 1% </span>of the<br> population, according to a new report. India is a<br> place of increasingly stark extremes in wealth. In<br> the same India where millions use smartphones,<br> millions live in poverty. Within India, there are many<br> different countries. One is high-flying and tech-savvy,<br> with people driving flashy cars in and out of top-starred<br> hotels and clubs. Another is white-collared middle class,<br> and another is still struggling to survive.
This economic<br> disparity leads to poorer lifestyles for majority population,<br> whereas a few gets to live luxurious lives. This may lead to<br> psychological issues in the less fortunate people. The serious<br> implication of this is unrest in the society.
<br><br>
Government all over the world are taking necessary steps<br> to alleviate financial disparities. Some of the solutions<br> suggested by experts are as follows:
<br><br>
1. Raise the minimum wage. In many places around the world,<br> workers at the <span> low end of the wage scale</span> cannot earn enough<br> to rise above the poverty line. In nations that have an <br> minimum wage, raising this rate could help improve the lives<br> and asset-building capabilities of millions of people
<br><br>
2. <span>Increase union membership and power</span> . Labor unions help<br> increase the earning power of their members, and their<br> presence can also help raise the wages of non-members. 
<br><br>

3. <span> Introduce land reforms and raise taxation for the wealthy:</span><br>
 We should work towards reducing <span> asset inequality</span> through<br> redistributive land reforms but also through inheritance<br> taxes, preventing monopoly of control over water, forests<br> and mineral resources and reducing <span> financial concentration.</span><br> The equality of opportunity needs to be increased through<br> good quality and universal public provision of essential amenities<br> and social services. We can raise the public resources for <br>doing all this by taxing the wealthy more and by increasing<br> the effective taxation of corporations, which have benefited <br>greatly from the boom and more than doubled their share of<br> national income, but not been taxed accordingly.
<br><br>

4. <span> Give a voice to oppressed groups:</span> We can tackle bias<br> against caste and gender first of all by recognising the<br> value and dignity of all work (including unpaid work) and<br> all workers (including those in the most difficult arduous<br> and degraded occupations)
<br><br>
