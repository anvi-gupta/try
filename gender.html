        <p>
           <span> Gender Inequality</span> refers to the discriminatory behavior of<br> the society towards women. The problem of inequality in<br>
employment being one of the most pressing issues today.<br> This discrimination can be in the form of <span> unequal rights,<br> status or opportunities.</span> Historically, women have remained<br> marginalized and oppressed due to the patriarchal trends<br> that had prevailed in every culture. The society in which<br> we live has been shaped historically by
males. The population<br> of women in our country is greater than men but even then<br> people do not educate the females and they are not given the<br> freedom to grow. This results in very major problems. Man and <br> woman are both the creation of the same God, yet women are <br> still considered <span> down-trodden second-class citizens</span> in many cultures.

<br><br>
Some of the solutions to this problem are:-
<br><br>
<span> 1.Give girls access to education.</span>
<br><br>
There are <span>130 million girls</span> in the world who are not in school.<br> Although there has been a <span> significant boost</span> in girlsâ€™ enrollment<br> in schools, there is still much progress to be made. Girls are more<br> likely than boys to never receive an education. There are 15 million<br> girls in the world of primary-school age who will never enter a<br> classroom, compared to about 10 million boys.By receiving an<br> education, girls can develop fundamental skills and gain <br>invaluable knowledge that allows them to thrive in their careers<br> and simply make decisions that will improve their lives.
<br><br>
<span> 2.Give women platforms to be in power and achieve economic success.</span>
<br><br>
Globally, women have <span> less political</span> representation than men. Around<br> the world, <span>62 percent </span> of countries have never had a female head of<br> government or state for at least one year in the past <span>half-century</span>, <br>including the United States. The number of women in political positions<br> compared to men is alarmingly disproportionate.
<br><br>
<span> 3.End child marriage.</span> <br><br>
In some cultures, it is acceptable if not expected for girls to<br> marry at a young age. Every year, <span>12 million girls marry before<br> the age of 18 worldwide</span>. Child marriage most affects girls and<br> is mainly fueled by gender inequality and poverty. This practice<br> is a violation of human rights as it prohibits women from making<br> decisions about their own lives.
